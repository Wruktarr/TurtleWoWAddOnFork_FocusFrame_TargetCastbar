# FocusFrame_TargetCastbar
Adds a castbar to the default target frame. (Copy of FocusFrame castbar but for target instead. Requires [FocusFrame](https://github.com/wardz/FocusFrame) to work.)

**Update 2019**  
Development has been ceased due to the official release of WoW Classic.

## Installation
1. Download latest [version here.](https://github.com/wardz/FocusFrame_TargetCastbar/releases)
2. Extract (unzip) the downloaded file into your `WoW/Interface/AddOns` folder.
3. Remove any suffixes from the addon's folder name. E.g: `FocusFrame_TargetCastbar-v1.0` to `FocusFrame_TargetCastbar`.

## Notes
- Requires that FocusFrame is enabled and `/foption strictaura` sat to disabled (default is disabled).
- Cast tracking have a range of 40yards. You may increase it by following tutorial [here](https://github.com/wardz/FocusFrame/wiki/Combatlog-Distance)
